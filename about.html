        <h2>Hi, I’m Cameron.</h2>
        <p>An international photographer based in Toronto.<br>
<br>
 Photography is about&nbsp; story telling. Capturing moments in photos that bring us back  years to come.&nbsp;  It's a way of connecting experiences with others, and provides us with something tangible to share our memories and emotions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
	    	      <br>
	      <b> What makes me qualified to work with you?</b> <br>
	      <br>
        <p>Several years of diverse photography experiences have taught me to anticipate moments -&nbsp; to focus on the details that tell the story, that bring candid moments to life, and to otherwise prepare&nbsp; ahead of time to ensure no shot is missed. But more than that, I bring a deep passion for storytelling through imagery - and finding the images that best tell that story. Together, let's tell your story.</p>
<p><b>What's my story?&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><br>
	  Born in Edinburgh, Scotland, we moved to Canada at an early age to join my grandparents here. We traveled home several times over the years and I had several opportunities to work there (including a Fish and Chips shop!)&nbsp;. After graduating McMaster University and the University of Toronto&nbsp; &nbsp;- I spent several years working as an Events Coordinator for a college in Toronto, bringing students together through a variety of experiences including sightseeing trips,&nbsp; sports events,&nbsp; camping trips, and career building workshops. I was also in charge of developing media for the college - and took lots of pictures and videos that the students got access to and that the college used for marketing.<br>
	<br> 
	Having been introduced to the outdoors at a young age through our uncles cottage in the Kawartha Highlands, I developed a passion for hiking. When another uncle returned from hiking the Camino de Santiago - I was flabergassed that anyone could walk the length of a country. I quickly learned about the Pacific Crest Trail, and after several shorter international hikes, decided I was ready and flew to Campo, California, at the border of Mexico and the United States. From there I hiked north through the desert, the alpine peaks, the mountain forests, volanic fields, and finished 5 months to the day later in the Washington Cascades. To my reluctance - I only packed my phone camera for the trip and in retrospect wish I had beared the extra weight of a camera.  <br>
<br>On returning, I got into programming and developed business management software for companies to manage all their data and administrative work in one place. Seeing an opportunity to manage my own work, I partnered with the company, and began create my own applications to help companies manage and automate their workflows. <br>
<br>
Most recently, I completed another thru hike of the Te Araroa in New Zealand, which spans from the top of the north island at Cape Reigna, down to the bottom of the south island at Bluff. Finally living out the life long dream of becoming an oversized Hobbit. I invested heavy into my camera gear for this trip and have some stunning photos which are also blogged about on my Instagram. Some of which I'll make available in my portfolio. <br>
<br>
With all that said, Ive had many opportunities and various events to practise photography and videography - in particularly challenging conditions. As a highly organized and meticulous person, I have no doubt that we can make your vision a reality. My services page has an outline of some of the packages I offer, and you can arrange a consultation through my contact page - or even just drop a question if you have any! Cheers! </p>
